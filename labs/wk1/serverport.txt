1.What is the definition of server port?

All network-connected devices by default come equipped with a standardized port that has a designated number. 
These numbers are resererved for specific protocols and their associated function
EX. HTTP always goes to port 80

2.What is server port range?

Port numbers can run from 0 to 65353. Port numbers from 0 to 1023 are reserved for common TCP/IP applications and are called well-known ports. The use of well-known ports allows client applications to easily locate the corresponding server application processes on other hosts.

3.How many bits does number above represent?(FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WORD YOUR QUESTIONS BETTER)

The most common is hexadecimal. In hexadecimal notation, 4 bits (a nibble) are represented by a single digit. There is obviously a problem with this since 4 bits gives 16 possible combinations, and there are only 10 unique decimal digits, 0 to 9.
